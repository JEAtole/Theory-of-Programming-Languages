Laboratory Activities

**Instructions:**

## Act 1 - Palindrome

Write a Java program that takes a string as input and checks if it is a palindrome. 
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forwards and backward.
Example: racecar, level, rotator.

## Act 2 - Letter Counter

Develop a Java program that takes a string and a character as input. The program should count the number of occurrences of the given character in the input string and display the count.

## Act 3 - DFA

Review the state diagram provided for a DFA (Deterministic Finite Automaton) accepting strings ending with '01' over the input alphabet âˆ‘ = {0, 1}.
Analyze the diagram and develop an equivalent Java program.

## Act 4 - Mini Compiler

Create a Java program for a mini compiler that processes a Java variable assignment statement, like 'int x = 10;', and conducts lexical, syntax, and semantic analyses on the input.
